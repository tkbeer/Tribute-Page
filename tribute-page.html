      <h2>The Clone Wars</h2>
      <p>Ahsoka Tano, nicknamed Snips by her master, was a Force-sensitive Togruta female from the planet Shili who was trained as a Jedi apprentice during the Clone Wars, the conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Tano was assigned to Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker by Jedi Grand Master Yoda, and she demonstrated an eagerness to prove herself worthy to be his apprentice.</p>
      
      <p>Later, Tano and her master achieved many things during the war including stopping the Blue Shadow Virus, freeing Togruta slaves from Kiros, saving her Master and many others on multiple occasions, and even halting a plot masterminded by Darth Sidious himself.</p>
      
      <p>Around 20 BBY, Tano was framed for the bombing of the Jedi Temple hangar and other homicides, by none other than her friend Barriss Offee. Desperate to clear her name, Ahsoka had escaped into the Coruscant underworld. Tano came very close to a conviction and death sentence, but she was acquitted at the last minute by the forced confession of a captured Offee. While the Council pardoned Tano and offered to bring her back into the Order, Tano refused, and she left the Jedi Temple. </p>
      
      <p>Tano briefly returned to lead Republic forces during the Siege of Mandalore, and faced Darth Maul and his forces although Order 66 was enacted during the conflict and Tano, faking her death after being betrayed by the 501st Legion, was forced into hiding.</p>
      
      <br>

      <h2>Post Clone Wars</h2>
      <p>After the Galactic Empire came to power, Tano went into hiding on Thabeska and Raada. Following the evacuation of Raada, Tano joined Senator Bail Organa's growing rebel movement. She became the manager of his intelligence network and adopted the codename "Fulcrum." As Fulcrum, Tano provided intelligence to various rebel factions including Hera Syndulla's Spectres rebel cell.</p>
      <p>Tano's efforts against the Empire brought her into contact with the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader, who, unknown to her, was actually her former master, Anakin Skywalker, as well as the Imperial Inquisitors. Following the mission to Malachor, Tano became lost to the rubble and shadows of the Sith temple and was believed by many including Jarrus and Bridger to have perished during a duel with Darth Vader.</p>
      <p>However, Tano was unexpectedly saved from Vader's wrath by a future Ezra Bridger, who pulled her through a time portal into the World Between Worlds, a dimension of the Force connecting all time and space. After a confrontation with Darth Sidious, who desired access to the dimension, Tano returned to her time, promising Bridger that she would find him once she returned. After the end of the Galactic Civil War, Tano returned to a freed Lothal and joined Sabine Wren in her quest to find a missing Bridger, who had disappeared during the liberation of Lothal.</p>
